## Scope
Although the inhalation of droplets may be reduced significantly if a face shield is worn by the virus-free person [5], we assert this mitigation effect may still be improved if we redesign this shield to reduce even more the proportion of smaller-sized droplets into the nose. 

To do this we first aim to check the effectiveness of face shields that are currently commercially available. Then we will investigate the effectiveness of a proposed novel face shield, and compare the results.

Our investigation will focus on varying particular variables, including:
- depth of face shield relative from it's front to the wearer's face,
- distance from the wearer to the speaker, and
- non-conventional design modifications of the face shield.

These scenarios will both be investigated with the assumption that the person not speaking will be inhaling at their maximum volumetric rate, and inhaling fully thru their nose. The speaking person's jet characteristics will be idealised, based on experimental data [6] where available, and assumed to point directly towards the wearer of the shield. The face shield's dimensional characteristics will be averaged from common, commercially-available products [^1].

## Methodology
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) will be used to conduct a number of numerical experiments where various parameters are varied. To achieve this within a shortened timeframe the [OpenFOAM](https://openfoam.org/) software will be used to run numerous, simultaneous CFD simulations on self-owned infrastructure (to reduce cost).

This finite-volume CFD approach will include low computational-cost (Reynolds-averaged) turbulence modelling of the airflow created due to speaking, which includes appropriate modelling of flow around the shield towards the nose of the person assumed to be inhaling the virus. The person inhaling will be represented as a geometry created by [NIOSH](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/data/datasets/rd-10130-2020-0/default.html).

At the start modelling the flow out of the mouth will be done assuming a steady-state base flow while introducing intermittent plosive-type sounds later. This will shift the fluid behaviour from steady-state to transient, adding very significant computational cost to accommodate this.

Due to our non-empirical experimental method, certain activities such as validation and verification should be also undertaken to provide confidence our numerical experiments are accurate reflections of the 'real-world', while also ensuring error introduced by the numerical methods are non-significant. Specifically our numerical results will be validated against experimental results, similar to some already experimentally investigated [7]. We will also verify the insensitivity of numerical results to numerically-based parameters used to generate these results, focussing especially on turbulence-related methods and parameters.
