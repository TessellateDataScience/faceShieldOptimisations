# Numerical investigation of speech-driven airflow between two people: quantification of face shields' effectiveness against airborne transmission of viruses for the wearer
## Summary
_We use Computational Fluid Dynamics to investigate and assess the airflow interaction between a person speaking and another person in close proximity who is wearing a commercially-available face shield. We assess this airflow with interest in particulates (representing a virus) suspended in the airflow, then attempt to quantify the risk that this airborne virus is transmitted from the speaker to the other person._

Once confident our modelling accurately reflects reality (via validation against experimental results and numerical parameter sensitiviy studies), we will then attempt to design a improved shield using an iterative approach, and assess it's effectiveness (i.e. risk quantification) as compared to wearing both a face mask and face shield.

**We believe in seeking more efficious & cost-effective preventative measures.**

## Potential _Research Impact_
The expected, potential, impacts are assuming the research objectives are achieved. The impacts are considered in relation to the Australian Governments's position on research impact [1], and are clustered into particular groups of people:

1. As severe negative health impacts from having COVID have been seen in certain cases, such as 'long COVID', we believe the probable small increase in effectiveness is warranted given the significant financial impact on the sufferer from these such conditions. However, we are aware other medical research into determing more exactly who will get long COVID is also necessary to allow targeted intervention of these people.

2. As we aim to replace the mask and shield combination with a transparent shield, we expect this advancement will also more broadly benefit people in industries where visibility-of-the mouth and clarity-of-speech is needed and beneficial. This would primarily include: education, speech pathology, health, psychology. We understand the financial burden this could cause particular groups (such as public education), thus we will offset this via requiring purchasing of the shield by more wealthy groups.

3. We also believe our face shield will have appeal to everyday people who wish to purchase them instead of face masks for ergonomic reasons, potentially leading to financial revenue that conributes towards completing these research objectives.

We believe our approach of quantifying the risk into a simpler quantity can be broadly adopted for other PPE assessment, allowing more accuracy in deciding on an appropriate level of protection for the wearer. We realise this requires the concurrent devlopment of quantifiying and standardising 'exposure risk' into particular categories (e.g. high to low risk), which will believe is challenging to undertake accurately.
