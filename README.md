# Computational modelling of speech-driven airflow between two people: face-shields' against airborne transmission of COVID-19
## Summary
_We use Computational Fluid Dynamics to investigate and assess the airflow produced during an interaction between a person speaking and another person in close proximity (who is wearing a standard face shield)._ 

In particular we are 'modelling' a scenario where we assume the person speaking is infected with a virus and is transmitting this virus via tiny droplets as they speak. Once confident our modelling accurately reflects reality we'll attempt to design an improved shield that has the ability to reduce this airborne-virus transmission, ultimately hoping to contribute another line-of-defence that helps during the next pandemic.

## Getting involved
You are highly encouraged to help address the inequity in vaccination rates across countries. You can contribute to this project from any background (whether a student, researcher, software developer, doctor, nurse, etc). All that's required is a willingness to learn (including more advanced computer skills). We would also love you to tell people you know about this project and help make this citizen science approach known to a wider global audience.

> If you're interested in dipping your toes into some 'computation science' research, please read our [getting started guide](https://github.com/TessellateDataScience/faceShieldOptimisations/tree/main/getStarted).

For researchers, potential collaborators are encouraged to only contribute Content that they intend to give to Tessellate Data Science (see 'Use of our work'), and also where there is lesser conflict regarding any intellectual property (IP) that may be generated from this Content. We intend to [protect ideas](https://github.com/TessellateDataScience/faceShieldOptimisations/wiki/3.-Innovation) in the broader public interest using these arguably outdated legal IP mechanisms - to prevent larger, predatory companies 'locking-up' potential innovations (a used mechanism in the Big Pharma industry).

## Research deliverables
We expect a number of outcomes that will be generated from this research:
1. Advancing state-of-the-art knowledge with potential to affect millions of people in a significant way.
2. Inventive products (that have Patent merit) with liberal licensing encouraging further innovation.
3. 'Turnkey' computational paradigm (including software platform) that is ready-to-roll, supporting both pure (basic) research and also outcome #2.

## Potential _Research Impact_
The expected 'research impacts' are assuming the research objectives are achieved. The impacts are considered in relation to the Australian Governments's position on research impact [3], and are clustered into particular groups of people:

1. As severe negative health impacts from having COVID have been seen in certain cases, such as 'long COVID', we believe the probable small increase in effectiveness is warranted given the significant financial impact on the sufferer from these such conditions. However, we are aware other medical research into determing more exactly who will get long COVID is also necessary to allow targeted intervention of these people.

2. As we aim to replace the mask and shield combination with a transparent shield, we expect this advancement will also more broadly benefit people in industries where visibility-of-the mouth and clarity-of-speech is needed and beneficial. This would primarily include: education, speech pathology, health, psychology. 

3. We also believe our face shield will have appeal to everyday people who wish to purchase them instead of face masks for ergonomic reasons, potentially leading to financial revenue that contributes towards completing these research objectives.

We believe our approach of quantifying the risk into a simpler quantity can be broadly adopted for other PPE assessment, allowing more accuracy in deciding on an appropriate level of protection for the wearer. We realise this requires the concurrent development of quantifiying and standardising 'exposure risk' (e.g. high to low risk categories of common situations), which will believe is more challenging to undertake accurately than this investigation.
