# Numerical investigation of speech-driven airflow between two people: face-shields' effectiveness against airborne transmission of COVID-19 for the wearer
## Summary
_We use Computational Fluid Dynamics [1] to investigate and assess the airflow and, in particular the bioaerosols, interaction between a person speaking and another person in close proximity (who is wearing a commercially-available face shield)._

Once confident our modelling accurately reflects reality (via validation against experimental results and numerical parameter's sensitivity studies), we will then attempt to design a improved shield using an iterative approach, and assess it's effectiveness as compared to status-quo products.

## Research deliverables
We expect a number of outcomes that will be generated from this research:
1. Advancing state-of-the-art knowledge with potential to affect millions of people in a significant way.
2. Inventive products (that have Patent merit) with liberal licensing encouraging further innovation.
3. 'Turnkey' computational paradigm (including software platform) that is ready-to-roll, supporting both pure (basic) research and also outcome #2.

## Potential _Research Impact_
The expected 'research impacts' are assuming the research objectives are achieved. The impacts are considered in relation to the Australian Governments's position on research impact [2], and are clustered into particular groups of people:

1. As severe negative health impacts from having COVID have been seen in certain cases, such as 'long COVID', we believe the probable small increase in effectiveness is warranted given the significant financial impact on the sufferer from these such conditions. However, we are aware other medical research into determing more exactly who will get long COVID is also necessary to allow targeted intervention of these people.

2. As we aim to replace the mask and shield combination with a transparent shield, we expect this advancement will also more broadly benefit people in industries where visibility-of-the mouth and clarity-of-speech is needed and beneficial. This would primarily include: education, speech pathology, health, psychology. 

3. We also believe our face shield will have appeal to everyday people who wish to purchase them instead of face masks for ergonomic reasons, potentially leading to financial revenue that contributes towards completing these research objectives.

We believe our approach of quantifying the risk into a simpler quantity can be broadly adopted for other PPE assessment, allowing more accuracy in deciding on an appropriate level of protection for the wearer. We realise this requires the concurrent development of quantifiying and standardising 'exposure risk' (e.g. high to low risk categories of common situations), which will believe is more challenging to undertake accurately than this investigation.
