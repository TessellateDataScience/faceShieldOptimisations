## Investigation 1: 2-dimensional flow
### Description of airflow
Simplified 2-dimensional airflow (infinitely-thin, horizontal cross-section) shows the air from the jet produced by mouth (left circle represents person speaking) travelling away and outward from centreline, reaching the second person (represented by right circle) then flowing around them. A visualisation image representing this simplified 2D flow regime is shown below.

### Discussion and implications
This represents an idealised case where the jet is oriented exactly towards person B. As this is unlikely, the flow around person B is likely to be modified (breaking the symmetry that exists in this particular case). However, even if these jet angles (away from this ideal) are significant the diverging (outward) flow pattern suggest airflow generated by the speaker would generally come into contact with the other person. 

Further, the simplification to 2-dimensions warrants investigation as 3-dimensional flow is intrinsic to turbulence, in addition to possibly 3D flow features generated by a) realistic 3D representations of people's heads and b) the flow coming out of the speaker's mouth.
