## Rationale
Some researchers argue that face masks likely don't have the level of protection they claim [1] in real-world scenarios [^1]. Thus, we propose face shields may be a suitable alternative with more protection stability, even when worn improperly, as compared to masks. We consider this particularly important when virus transmission is dominated by the airborne route, such as COVID-19 [2].

To assess the protective ability of shields requires we understand and quantify the airflow dynamics around them. We limit ourselves to investigating the fluid dynamics of an interaction between two people in a common settings such as when speaking in no-velocity (surrounding) airflow environments which could represent places such as hospitals, schools/universities, and offices.

## Introduction
The fluid dynamics of airflow involved comprises a combination of likely turbulent jet flow and potentially two-phase flow [3]. A turbulent jet normally appears emanating from the person speaking, which is carried forwards. Droplets containing the virus, also present in speaking, tend to fall towards the ground at increasingly shorter distances for higher sizes, while increasingly smaller-sized ones tend to follow the airflow pattern more closely.

Adding complexity to the overall jet is the variation in flow out of the mouth due to differing sounds of speech [4]. Further, plosive sounds (e.g. 'k' & 'p' sounds) create vortex ring-like structures that mostly retain their momentum and hence propagate further downstream (as compared to non-plosive types) which also interacts with more-diffused jet created by non-plosive sounds.

If a face mask is worn by the infected person while speaking the overall jet momentum may be reduced significantly, however the breakup of droplets may cause the other person to inhale more of the virus, due to the smaller droplet sizes (which reach further than droplets). If a face shield is worn by the infected person the transmission of particles (representing a virus) to the other person has been shown to be decreased [5].
